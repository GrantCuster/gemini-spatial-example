# Gemini vision example

Simple front-end for Gemini image prompting, meant as a starting point for developers. It uses vite-express with a minimal server to access the API.

Put your Gemini API Key (get from https://ai.google.dev/) into the `example.env` file and rename to `.env`. Use `npm install` and `npm run dev` to run locally.
